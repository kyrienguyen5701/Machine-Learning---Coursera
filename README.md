# Machine-Learning---Coursera
My programs for assignments from the machine learning course provided by Stanford University on Coursera.
Skills I acquired from this course:
- Gradient Descent and its optimizations
- Linear Regression and Logical Regression with Regularization
- Neural Networks and Backpropagation
- Model Selection and solving the problem of Overfitting/Underfitting (Bias vs. Variance)
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction)
- Collaborative Filtering and Anomaly Detection
- Data Augmentation
Applications I "made" in this course:
- Spam Classifier
- Anomaly Detector
- Movie Recommender
